Data placement strategy is required by the processors with dedicated memory to move data to their memory whenever needed for performing tasks and operations. CoGaDB handles this requirement using dedicated GPU buffer manager module. GPU buffer manager\cite{cogadb_design_impl} is responsible for providing required data to the GPU operators whenever input columns are requested by them. It applies data placement strategies to fetch data into GPU memory from main-memory whenever requested data is not available. Hence, GPU buffer manager of CoGaDB handles all data transfer related operations in heterogeneous processor environment.
