CoGaGB is designed with the objective of using all available processors depending upon the operators to improve query processing and performance. From the query perspective, it is not generally recommended that to perform all query operations using a single processor, since some operators can give high throughput if executed on other processor. Thus, CoGaDB uses operator-based scheduling to distribute the set of queries on all available processing resources\cite{cogadb_design_impl}.
Queries can be processed in pipeline manner, where each operator requests the next block of operators, and bulk processing, where each operator takes the entire input and generates the output by applying all the required operations. Taking multi-processor architectural design into consideration, bulk processing can provide high efficiency since we can minimize data transfer between processors and achieve inter-operator parallelism by constructing complex query plans with the prospect of running them parallelly in sub-plans. Therefore, CoGaDB uses the operator-at-a-time bulk processing model with operator-based scheduling to make the most efficient use of the memory hierarchy.
