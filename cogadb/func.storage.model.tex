CoGaDB needs an efficient storage model to work with the requirement of loading entire database in main-memory during startup. This database system is designed to target OLAP\footnote{Online analytical processing - systems mostly optimized for read operations} workloads and requires storage model which can analyze data with huge density of rows and columns.

Taking above requirements into consideration, CoGaDB choose a columnar data layout as the storage model because of higher compression rates which can save immense memory and gives provision of storing data more efficiently due to the columnar nature. As data is loaded into the main-memory during startup, CoGaDB uses in-memory columnar store and stores data in highly efficient data structures which are optimized for in-memory databases. Hence, it focuses on storing data in column-wise manner and efficiently manages string columns such as VARCHAR using dictionary encoding standards\cite{cogadb_dict_compression}. This data structure is maintained during transfer from CPU's main-memory to the GPU's memory and operations are performed on the same columnar format.
