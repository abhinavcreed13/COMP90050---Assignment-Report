GPU-accelerated database systems needs to handle environment of multiple-processing devices. One of the major problem is to decide which operation should be performed on which device. One of the earliest solution to this problem was given by He and others where they proposed Hybrid CPU/GPU query optimizer\cite{cogadb_relational_query}. CoGaGB addresses this problem of query placement and optimization by building their custom solution - Hybrid Query Processing Engine(HyPE).

In heterogeneous processor environment, it is very critical for system to make use of all available computational resources and memory bandwidth for providing most efficient performance. CoGaDB's HyPE handles this requirement by applying several time estimation and processor selection algorithm to analyze which processing device should be selected for performing bulk operator operations. During this, HyPE optimizes physical query plan by applying several optimization algorithms and make use of Hawk engine to produce highly optimized machine code variant for target processing device. Hence, CoGaDB handles query placement and optimization using their Hybrid Query Processing Engine(HyPE) with the use of Hardware Adaptive Query Compiler(Hawk).
