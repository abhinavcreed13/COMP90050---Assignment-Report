This property evaluates the adaptive nature of any database system in provided heterogeneous processing environment. Due to the increase in customized vendor-specific processors, portability is becoming an important factor for database systems.

CoGaDB achieves this hardware-oblivious design by implementing all vendor-specific operators in the system. This strategy leads to high development and implementation cost, but provides highly efficient portability. Furthermore, CoGaDB uses its HyPE engine to induce vendor-specific optimizations in the physical query which makes the system extremely hardware-oblivious.
