    abstract="Nowadays, the performance of processors is primarily bound by a fixed energy budget, the power wall. This forces hardware vendors to optimize processors for specific tasks, which leads to an increasingly heterogeneous hardware landscape. Although efficient algorithms for modern processors such as GPUs are heavily investigated, we also need to prepare the database optimizer to handle computations on heterogeneous processors. GPUs are an interesting base for case studies, because they already offer many difficulties we will face tomorrow.",

% abstract="Since a decade, the database community researches opportunities to exploit graphics processing units to accelerate query processing. While the developed GPU algorithms often outperform their CPU counterparts, it is not beneficial to keep processing devices idle while over utilizing others. Therefore, an approach is needed that effectively distributes a workload on available (co-)processors while providing accurate performance estimations for the query optimizer. In this paper, we extend our hybrid query-processing engine with heuristics that optimize query processing for response time and throughput simultaneously via inter-device parallelism. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new approach doubles the throughput compared to our previous solution and state-of-the-art approaches, because of nearly equal device utilization while preserving accurate performance estimations.",
